Overview of the project
Image Classification
Train a CNN on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits using TensorFlow.

Objective
.Teach a computer to recognize handwritten numbers (0 to 9) using a smart model called a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).
 .Use the MNIST dataset (a famous set of digit images) to train and test the model

  Features
  .Uses images of digits (28x28 pixels, black & white).
  .Makes the computer learn patterns in the digits.
  .Uses a special model (CNN) that is good at seeing images.
   .The model gets better by learning from thousands of examples.
    .After training, the model can guess digits in new images.
